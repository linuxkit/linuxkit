// these platforms are used only as the source for registry.PushManifestList(). Since it is
// configured to ignore missing, we could include dozens if we wanted; it doesn't hurt, adding maybe a few seconds to
// the whole run.
// Ideally, we could just look for all tags that start with linuxkit/foo:<hash>-*, but the registry API
// only supports "list all the tags" and "get a specific tag", no "get by pattern". The "get a specific tag"
// is exactly what registry.PushManifestList() uses, so no benefit to use doing that in advance,
// while "list all tags" is slow, and has to cycle through all of the (growing numbers of) tags
// before we know what exists. Might as well leave it as is.
