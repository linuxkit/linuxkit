This script assumes that is is run from the root of your Go package (for
example, "/go/src/app" if your GOPATH is set to "/go").

In Go 1.4, a feature was introduced to supply the canonical "import path" for a
given package in a comment attached to a package statement
(https://golang.org/s/go14customimport).

This script allows us to take a generic directory of Go source files such as
"/go/src/app" and determine that the canonical "import path" of where that code
expects to live and reference itself is "github.com/jsmith/my-cool-app".  It
will then ensure that "/go/src/github.com/jsmith/my-cool-app" is a symlink to
"/go/src/app", which allows us to build and run it under the proper package
name.

For compatibility with versions of Go older than 1.4, the "import path" may also
be placed in a file named ".godir".

Available Commands:

  $base download
  $base download -u
    (equivalent to "go get -d [args] [godir]")

  $base install
  $base install -race
    (equivalent to "go install [args] [godir]")

  $base run
  $base run -app -specific -arguments
    (assumes "GOPATH/bin" is in "PATH")
