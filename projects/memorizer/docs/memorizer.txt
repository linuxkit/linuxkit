             | Memorizer: Kernel Memory Access Patterns (KMAPs) |
             +--------------------------------------------------+

Introduction
============

Memorizer is a tool to record information about access to kernel objects:
specifically, it counts memory accesses from distinct IP addresses in the
kernel source and also the PID that accessed, thereby providing spatial and
temporal dimensions.

Interface via debugfs
=====================

The tool has a very simple interface at the moment. It can:

- Print out some statistics about memory allocations and memory accesses
- Control enable/disable of memory object allocation tracking and memory access
  tracing
- Print the KMAP using the debugfs file system

Enable object allocation tracking:
```bash
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/memorizer/memorizer_enabled
```

Enable object access tracking:
```bash
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/memorizer/memorizer_log_access
```

Show allocation statistics:
```bash
cat /sys/kernel/debug/memorizer/show_stats
```

Clear free'd objects:
```bash
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/memorizer/clear_object_list
```
    
Using Memorizer to Collect KMAPs
================================

Memorizer lacks push style logging and clearing of the object lists, therefore
it has the propensity of overflowing memory. The only way to manage the log and
current set of objects is to manually clear and print the KMAPs.

Therefore, a typical run using memorizer to create KMAPs includes:

```bash
# mount the debugfs filesystem if it isn't already
mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug
# clear free objects: the current system traces from boot with a lot of
# uninteresting data
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/clear_object_list
# enable memorizer object access tracking, which by default is off
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/memorizer_log_access
# Now run whatever test
tar zcf something.tar.gz /somedir &
ssh u@h:/somefile 
...
# Disable access loggin
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/memorizer/memorizer_log_access
# Disable memorizer object tracking: isn't necessary but will reduce noise
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/memorizer/memorizer_enabled
# Cat the results: make sure to pipe to something
cat /sys/kernel/debug/memorizer/kmap > test.kmap
```

Output Format
=============

Memorizer outputs data as text, which may change if space is a problem. The
format of the kmap file is as follows:

alloc_ip,pid,obj_va_ptr,size,alloc_jiffies,free_jiffies,free_ip,executable
  access_ip,access_pid,write_count,read_count
  access_ip,access_pid,write_count,read_count
  access_ip,access_pid,write_count,read_count
    ...
    ...

There are a few special error codes: 

    - Not all free_ip's could be obtained correctly and therefore some of these
      will be 0.
    - There is a bug where we insert into the live object map over another
      allocation, this implies that we are missing a free. So for now we mark
      the free_ip as 0xDEADBEEF.
