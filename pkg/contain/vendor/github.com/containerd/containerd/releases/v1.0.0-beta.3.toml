  title= "`ctr` makeover"
  description = """\
`ctr` is getting a ~makeover~! The end goal is for commands to be consistent and scoped.
Most notably:
- `push`, `pull` are now `images` subcommands: `ctr images push`, `ctr images pull`
- `fetch`, `fetch-object`, and `push-object` are `content` subcommands
- `rootfs unpack` is now `snapshot unpack`
- `apply` no longer exists. RIP"""

  [notes.gc]
  title= "Garbage collector improvements"
  description = """\
The garbage collector continues to improve with this release, including bug
fixes on the client causing races and a new lease feature for making retention
from the client easier.

The lease API was added to make it easier for clients to prevent content and
snapshots from being garbage collected while they are being actively worked on
(such as from pull, import, or checkpoint). The API includes functions for
creating, deleting, and listing leases. The lease gets attached to the context
and the backend metadata store sees it and associates newly created content
and snapshots with that lease.

Leases are currently acquired and released automatically through the client.
From the user perspective, fewer `gc.root` labels should be seen on client
during pull/import operations or left over after a failed operation."""
