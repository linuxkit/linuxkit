# We require a version of `setsid(1)` which supports the `-w`
# option, which is not available in all implementations (e.g. the
# `busybox` implementation does not support it). When this is run
# as part of a LinuxKit `init` image (rather than as a standalone
# container) we cannot guarantee which version of `setsid` will
# be present once the layers are combined, so we take a copy of
# our own, known good, version for use later.
