Subject: [PATCH 04/13] vmbus: Don't spam the logs with unknown GUIDs

With Hyper-V sockets device types are introduced on the fly. The pr_info()
then prints a message on every connection, which is way too verbose.  Since
there doesn't seem to be an easy way to check for registered services,
disable the pr_info() completely.
