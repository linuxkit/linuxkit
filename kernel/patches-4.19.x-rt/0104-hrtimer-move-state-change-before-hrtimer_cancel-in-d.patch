Subject: [PATCH 104/283] hrtimer: move state change before hrtimer_cancel in
 do_nanosleep()

There is a small window between setting t->task to NULL and waking the
task up (which would set TASK_RUNNING). So the timer would fire, run and
set ->task to NULL while the other side/do_nanosleep() wouldn't enter
freezable_schedule(). After all we are peemptible here (in
do_nanosleep() and on the timer wake up path) and on KVM/virt the
virt-CPU might get preempted.
So do_nanosleep() wouldn't enter freezable_schedule() but cancel the
timer which is still running and wait for it via
hrtimer_wait_for_timer(). Then wait_event()/might_sleep() would complain
that it is invoked with state != TASK_RUNNING.
This isn't a problem since it would be reset to TASK_RUNNING later
anyway and we don't rely on the previous state.

Move the state update to TASK_RUNNING before hrtimer_cancel() so there
are no complains from might_sleep() about wrong state.
