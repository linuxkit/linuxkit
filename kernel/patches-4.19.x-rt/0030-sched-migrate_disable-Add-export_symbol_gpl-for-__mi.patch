Subject: [PATCH] sched/migrate_disable: Add export_symbol_gpl for
 __migrate_disabled

Jonathan reported that lttng/modules can't use __migrate_disabled().
This function is only used by sched/core itself and the tracing
infrastructure to report the migrate counter (lttng does probably the
same). Since the rework migrate_disable() it moved from sched.h to
preempt.h and is became an exported function instead of a "static
inline" due to the header recursion of preempt vs sched.

Since the compiler inlines the function for sched/core usage, add a
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL to allow the module/LTTNG usage.
