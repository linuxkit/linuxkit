Subject: [PATCH 005/283] ARM: at91: Implement clocksource selection

Allow selecting and unselecting the PIT clocksource driver so it doesn't
have to be compile when unused.

+	  On platforms with 16-bit counters, two timer channels are combined

+	  It can also be used as a clock event device supporting oneshot mode.
