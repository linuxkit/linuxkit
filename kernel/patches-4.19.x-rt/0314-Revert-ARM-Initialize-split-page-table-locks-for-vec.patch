Subject: [PATCH 314/328] Revert "ARM: Initialize split page table locks for
 vector page"

[ Upstream commit 247074c44d8c3e619dfde6404a52295d8d671d38 ]

I'm dropping this patch, with its original description:

|ARM: Initialize split page table locks for vector page
|
|Without this patch, ARM can not use SPLIT_PTLOCK_CPUS if
|PREEMPT_RT_FULL=y because vectors_user_mapping() creates a
|VM_ALWAYSDUMP mapping of the vector page (address 0xffff0000), but no
|ptl->lock has been allocated for the page.  An attempt to coredump
|that page will result in a kernel NULL pointer dereference when
|follow_page() attempts to lock the page.
|
|The call tree to the NULL pointer dereference is:
|
|   do_notify_resume()
|      get_signal_to_deliver()
|         do_coredump()
|            elf_core_dump()
|               get_dump_page()
|                  __get_user_pages()
|                     follow_page()
|                        pte_offset_map_lock() <----- a #define
|                           ...
|                              rt_spin_lock()
|
|The underlying problem is exposed by mm-shrink-the-page-frame-to-rt-size.patch.

The patch named mm-shrink-the-page-frame-to-rt-size.patch was dropped
from the RT queue once the SPLIT_PTLOCK_CPUS feature (in a slightly
different shape) went upstream (somewhere between v3.12 and v3.14).

I can see that the patch still allocates a lock which wasn't there
before. However I can't trigger a kernel oops like described in the
patch by triggering a coredump.
