Subject: [PATCH 127/283] softirq: Avoid "local_softirq_pending" messages if
 task is in cpu_chill()

If the softirq thread enters cpu_chill() then ->state is UNINTERRUPTIBLE
and has no ->pi_blocked_on set and so its mask is not taken into account.

->sleeping_lock is increased by cpu_chill() since it is also requried to
avoid a splat by RCU in case cpu_chill() is used while a RCU-read lock
is held. Use the same mechanism for the softirq-pending check.
