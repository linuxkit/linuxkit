Linux kernel builds, based on mostly-vanilla upstream Linux kernels.
See [../docs/kernel-patches.md] for how the local patches in `patches-*`
are maintained.

The build is mostly silent. A local build can be run via `make tag`. To view
the output use `docker log -f <containerid>`. The build creates multiple
containers, so multiple invocations may be necessary. To view the full build
output one may also invoke `docker build .` and then copy the build artefacts
from the image afterwards.

To build with various debug options enabled, build the kernel with
`make DEBUG=1`. The options enabled are listed in `kernel_config.debug`. This allocates a significant amount of memory on boot and you may need to adjust the kernel config on some systems. Specifically:
