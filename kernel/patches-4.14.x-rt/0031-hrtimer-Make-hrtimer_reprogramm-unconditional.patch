Subject: [PATCH 031/437] hrtimer: Make hrtimer_reprogramm() unconditional

hrtimer_reprogram() needs to be available unconditionally for softirq based
hrtimers. Move the function and all required struct members out of the
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS #ifdef.

There is no functional change because hrtimer_reprogram() is only invoked
when hrtimer_cpu_base.hres_active is true. Making it unconditional
increases the text size for the CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=n case, but avoids
replication of that code for the upcoming softirq based hrtimers support.
