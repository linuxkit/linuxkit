+2.2 Inter-event hist triggers
+-----------------------------
+
+Inter-event hist triggers are hist triggers that combine values from
+one or more other events and create a histogram using that data.  Data
+from an inter-event histogram can in turn become the source for
+further combined histograms, thus providing a chain of related
+histograms, which is important for some applications.
+
+The most important example of an inter-event quantity that can be used
+in this manner is latency, which is simply a difference in timestamps
+between two events.  Although latency is the most important
+inter-event quantity, note that because the support is completely
+general across the trace event subsystem, any event field can be used
+in an inter-event quantity.
+
+An example of a histogram that combines data from other histograms
+into a useful chain would be a 'wakeupswitch latency' histogram that
+combines a 'wakeup latency' histogram and a 'switch latency'
+histogram.
+
+Normally, a hist trigger specification consists of a (possibly
+compound) key along with one or more numeric values, which are
+continually updated sums associated with that key.  A histogram
+specification in this case consists of individual key and value
+specifications that refer to trace event fields associated with a
+single event type.
+
+The inter-event hist trigger extension allows fields from multiple
+events to be referenced and combined into a multi-event histogram
+specification.  In support of this overall goal, a few enabling
+features have been added to the hist trigger support:
+
+  - In order to compute an inter-event quantity, a value from one
+    event needs to saved and then referenced from another event.  This
+    requires the introduction of support for histogram 'variables'.
+
+  - The computation of inter-event quantities and their combination
+    require some minimal amount of support for applying simple
+    expressions to variables (+ and -).
+
+  - A histogram consisting of inter-event quantities isn't logically a
+    histogram on either event (so having the 'hist' file for either
+    event host the histogram output doesn't really make sense).  To
+    address the idea that the histogram is associated with a
+    combination of events, support is added allowing the creation of
+    'synthetic' events that are events derived from other events.
+    These synthetic events are full-fledged events just like any other
+    and can be used as such, as for instance to create the
+    'combination' histograms mentioned previously.
+
+  - A set of 'actions' can be associated with histogram entries -
+    these can be used to generate the previously mentioned synthetic
+    events, but can also be used for other purposes, such as for
+    example saving context when a 'max' latency has been hit.
+
+  - Trace events don't have a 'timestamp' associated with them, but
+    there is an implicit timestamp saved along with an event in the
+    underlying ftrace ring buffer.  This timestamp is now exposed as a
+    a synthetic field named 'common_timestamp' which can be used in
+    histograms as if it were any other event field; it isn't an actual
+    field in the trace format but rather is a synthesized value that
+    nonetheless can be used as if it were an actual field.  By default
+    it is in units of nanoseconds; appending '.usecs' to a
+    common_timestamp field changes the units to microseconds.
+
+These features are decribed in more detail in the following sections.
+
+2.2.1 Histogram Variables
+-------------------------
+
+Variables are simply named locations used for saving and retrieving
+values between matching events.  A 'matching' event is defined as an
+event that has a matching key - if a variable is saved for a histogram
+entry corresponding to that key, any subsequent event with a matching
+key can access that variable.
+
+A variable's value is normally available to any subsequent event until
+it is set to something else by a subsequent event.  The one exception
+to that rule is that any variable used in an expression is essentially
+'read-once' - once it's used by an expression in a subsequent event,
+it's reset to its 'unset' state, which means it can't be used again
+unless it's set again.  This ensures not only that an event doesn't
+use an uninitialized variable in a calculation, but that that variable
+is used only once and not for any unrelated subsequent match.
+
+The basic syntax for saving a variable is to simply prefix a unique
+variable name not corresponding to any keyword along with an '=' sign
+to any event field.
+
+Either keys or values can be saved and retrieved in this way.  This
+creates a variable named 'ts0' for a histogram entry with the key
+'next_pid':
+
+  # echo 'hist:keys=next_pid:vals=$ts0:ts0=common_timestamp ... >> \
+	event/trigger
+
+The ts0 variable can be accessed by any subsequent event having the
+same pid as 'next_pid'.
+
+Variable references are formed by prepending the variable name with
+the '$' sign.  Thus for example, the ts0 variable above would be
+referenced as '$ts0' in expressions.
+
+Because 'vals=' is used, the common_timestamp variable value above
+will also be summed as a normal histogram value would (though for a
+timestamp it makes little sense).
+
+The below shows that a key value can also be saved in the same way:
+
+  # echo 'hist:timer_pid=common_pid:key=timer_pid ...' >> event/trigger
+
+If a variable isn't a key variable or prefixed with 'vals=', the
+associated event field will be saved in a variable but won't be summed
+as a value:
+
+  # echo 'hist:keys=next_pid:ts1=common_timestamp ... >> event/trigger
+
+Multiple variables can be assigned at the same time.  The below would
+result in both ts0 and b being created as variables, with both
+common_timestamp and field1 additionally being summed as values:
+
+  # echo 'hist:keys=pid:vals=$ts0,$b:ts0=common_timestamp,b=field1 ... >> \
+	event/trigger
+
+Note that variable assignments can appear either preceding or
+following their use.  The command below behaves identically to the
+command above:
+
+  # echo 'hist:keys=pid:ts0=common_timestamp,b=field1:vals=$ts0,$b ... >> \
+	event/trigger
+
+Any number of variables not bound to a 'vals=' prefix can also be
+assigned by simply separating them with colons.  Below is the same
+thing but without the values being summed in the histogram:
+
+  # echo 'hist:keys=pid:ts0=common_timestamp:b=field1 ... >> event/trigger
+
+Variables set as above can be referenced and used in expressions on
+another event.
+
+For example, here's how a latency can be calculated:
+
+  # echo 'hist:keys=pid,prio:ts0=common_timestamp ... >> event1/trigger
+  # echo 'hist:keys=next_pid:wakeup_lat=common_timestamp-$ts0 ... >> event2/trigger
+
+In the first line above, the event's timetamp is saved into the
+variable ts0.  In the next line, ts0 is subtracted from the second
+event's timestamp to produce the latency, which is then assigned into
+yet another variable, 'wakeup_lat'.  The hist trigger below in turn
+makes use of the wakeup_lat variable to compute a combined latency
+using the same key and variable from yet another event:
+
+  # echo 'hist:key=pid:wakeupswitch_lat=$wakeup_lat+$switchtime_lat ... >> event3/trigger
+
+2.2.2 Synthetic Events
+----------------------
+
+Synthetic events are user-defined events generated from hist trigger
+variables or fields associated with one or more other events.  Their
+purpose is to provide a mechanism for displaying data spanning
+multiple events consistent with the existing and already familiar
+usage for normal events.
+
+To define a synthetic event, the user writes a simple specification
+consisting of the name of the new event along with one or more
+variables and their types, which can be any valid field type,
+separated by semicolons, to the tracing/synthetic_events file.
+
+For instance, the following creates a new event named 'wakeup_latency'
+with 3 fields: lat, pid, and prio.  Each of those fields is simply a
+variable reference to a variable on another event:
+
+  # echo 'wakeup_latency \
+          u64 lat; \
+          pid_t pid; \
+	  int prio' >> \
+	  /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/synthetic_events
+
+Reading the tracing/synthetic_events file lists all the currently
+defined synthetic events, in this case the event defined above:
+
+  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/synthetic_events
+    wakeup_latency u64 lat; pid_t pid; int prio
+
+An existing synthetic event definition can be removed by prepending
+the command that defined it with a '!':
+
+  # echo '!wakeup_latency u64 lat pid_t pid int prio' >> \
+    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/synthetic_events
+
+At this point, there isn't yet an actual 'wakeup_latency' event
+instantiated in the event subsytem - for this to happen, a 'hist
+trigger action' needs to be instantiated and bound to actual fields
+and variables defined on other events (see Section 6.3.3 below).
+
+Once that is done, an event instance is created, and a histogram can
+be defined using it:
+
+  # echo 'hist:keys=pid,prio,lat.log2:sort=pid,lat' >> \
+        /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/synthetic/wakeup_latency/trigger
+
+The new event is created under the tracing/events/synthetic/ directory
+and looks and behaves just like any other event:
+
+  # ls /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/synthetic/wakeup_latency
+        enable  filter  format  hist  id  trigger
+
+Like any other event, once a histogram is enabled for the event, the
+output can be displayed by reading the event's 'hist' file.
+
+2.2.3 Hist trigger 'actions'
+----------------------------
+
+A hist trigger 'action' is a function that's executed whenever a
+histogram entry is added or updated.
+
+The default 'action' if no special function is explicity specified is
+as it always has been, to simply update the set of values associated
+with an entry.  Some applications, however, may want to perform
+additional actions at that point, such as generate another event, or
+compare and save a maximum.
+
+The following additional actions are available.  To specify an action
+for a given event, simply specify the action between colons in the
+hist trigger specification.
+
+  - onmatch(matching.event).<synthetic_event_name>(param list)
+
+    The 'onmatch(matching.event).<synthetic_event_name>(params)' hist
+    trigger action is invoked whenever an event matches and the
+    histogram entry would be added or updated.  It causes the named
+    synthetic event to be generated with the values given in the
+    'param list'.  The result is the generation of a synthetic event
+    that consists of the values contained in those variables at the
+    time the invoking event was hit.
+
+    The 'param list' consists of one or more parameters which may be
+    either variables or fields defined on either the 'matching.event'
+    or the target event.  The variables or fields specified in the
+    param list may be either fully-qualified or unqualified.  If a
+    variable is specified as unqualified, it must be unique between
+    the two events.  A field name used as a param can be unqualified
+    if it refers to the target event, but must be fully qualified if
+    it refers to the matching event.  A fully-qualified name is of the
+    form 'system.event_name.$var_name' or 'system.event_name.field'.
+
+    The 'matching.event' specification is simply the fully qualified
+    event name of the event that matches the target event for the
+    onmatch() functionality, in the form 'system.event_name'.
+
+    Finally, the number and type of variables/fields in the 'param
+    list' must match the number and types of the fields in the
+    synthetic event being generated.
+
+    As an example the below defines a simple synthetic event and uses
+    a variable defined on the sched_wakeup_new event as a parameter
+    when invoking the synthetic event.  Here we define the synthetic
+    event:
+
+    # echo 'wakeup_new_test pid_t pid' >> \
+           /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/synthetic_events
+
+    # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/synthetic_events
+          wakeup_new_test pid_t pid
+
+    The following hist trigger both defines the missing testpid
+    variable and specifies an onmatch() action that generates a
+    wakeup_new_test synthetic event whenever a sched_wakeup_new event
+    occurs, which because of the 'if comm == "cyclictest"' filter only
+    happens when the executable is cyclictest:
+
+    # echo 'hist:keys=$testpid:testpid=pid:onmatch(sched.sched_wakeup_new).\
+            wakeup_new_test($testpid) if comm=="cyclictest"' >> \
+            /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_wakeup_new/trigger
+
+    Creating and displaying a histogram based on those events is now
+    just a matter of using the fields and new synthetic event in the
+    tracing/events/synthetic directory, as usual:
+
+    # echo 'hist:keys=pid:sort=pid' >> \
+           /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/synthetic/wakeup_new_test/trigger
+
+    Running 'cyclictest' should cause wakeup_new events to generate
+    wakeup_new_test synthetic events which should result in histogram
+    output in the wakeup_new_test event's hist file:
+
+    # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/synthetic/wakeup_new_test/hist
+
+    A more typical usage would be to use two events to calculate a
+    latency.  The following example uses a set of hist triggers to
+    produce a 'wakeup_latency' histogram:
+
+    First, we define a 'wakeup_latency' synthetic event:
+
+    # echo 'wakeup_latency u64 lat; pid_t pid; int prio' >> \
+            /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/synthetic_events
+
+    Next, we specify that whenever we see a sched_waking event for a
+    cyclictest thread, save the timestamp in a 'ts0' variable:
+
+    # echo 'hist:keys=$saved_pid:saved_pid=pid:ts0=common_timestamp.usecs \
+            if comm=="cyclictest"' >> \
+	    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_waking/trigger
+
+    Then, when the corresponding thread is actually scheduled onto the
+    CPU by a sched_switch event, calculate the latency and use that
+    along with another variable and an event field to generate a
+    wakeup_latency synthetic event:
+
+    # echo 'hist:keys=next_pid:wakeup_lat=common_timestamp.usecs-$ts0:\
+            onmatch(sched.sched_waking).wakeup_latency($wakeup_lat,\
+	            $saved_pid,next_prio) if next_comm=="cyclictest"' >> \
+	    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
+
+    We also need to create a histogram on the wakeup_latency synthetic
+    event in order to aggregate the generated synthetic event data:
+
+    # echo 'hist:keys=pid,prio,lat:sort=pid,lat' >> \
+            /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/synthetic/wakeup_latency/trigger
+
+    Finally, once we've run cyclictest to actually generate some
+    events, we can see the output by looking at the wakeup_latency
+    synthetic event's hist file:
+
+    # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/synthetic/wakeup_latency/hist
+
+  - onmax(var).save(field,..	.)
+
+    The 'onmax(var).save(field,...)' hist trigger action is invoked
+    whenever the value of 'var' associated with a histogram entry
+    exceeds the current maximum contained in that variable.
+
+    The end result is that the trace event fields specified as the
+    onmax.save() params will be saved if 'var' exceeds the current
+    maximum for that hist trigger entry.  This allows context from the
+    event that exhibited the new maximum to be saved for later
+    reference.  When the histogram is displayed, additional fields
+    displaying the saved values will be printed.
+
+    As an example the below defines a couple of hist triggers, one for
+    sched_waking and another for sched_switch, keyed on pid.  Whenever
+    a sched_waking occurs, the timestamp is saved in the entry
+    corresponding to the current pid, and when the scheduler switches
+    back to that pid, the timestamp difference is calculated.  If the
+    resulting latency, stored in wakeup_lat, exceeds the current
+    maximum latency, the values specified in the save() fields are
+    recoreded:
+
+    # echo 'hist:keys=pid:ts0=common_timestamp.usecs \
+            if comm=="cyclictest"' >> \
+            /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_waking/trigger
+
+    # echo 'hist:keys=next_pid:\
+            wakeup_lat=common_timestamp.usecs-$ts0:\
+            onmax($wakeup_lat).save(next_comm,prev_pid,prev_prio,prev_comm) \
+            if next_comm=="cyclictest"' >> \
+            /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
+
+    When the histogram is displayed, the max value and the saved
+    values corresponding to the max are displayed following the rest
+    of the fields:
+
+    # cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_switch/hist
+      { next_pid:       2255 } hitcount:        239
