Subject: [PATCH 251/437] rbtree: don't include the rcu header
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The RCU header pulls in spinlock.h and fails due not yet defined types:

|In file included from include/linux/spinlock.h:275:0,
|                 from include/linux/rcupdate.h:38,
|                 from include/linux/rbtree.h:34,
|                 from include/linux/rtmutex.h:17,
|                 from include/linux/spinlock_types.h:18,
|                 from kernel/bounds.c:13:
|include/linux/rwlock_rt.h:16:38: error: unknown type name ‘rwlock_t’
| extern void __lockfunc rt_write_lock(rwlock_t *rwlock);
|                                      ^

This patch moves the required RCU function from the rcupdate.h header file into
a new header file which can be included by both users.
