Subject: [PATCH 296/437] rt: Introduce cpu_chill()

Retry loops on RT might loop forever when the modifying side was
preempted. Add cpu_chill() to replace cpu_relax(). cpu_chill()
defaults to cpu_relax() for non RT. On RT it puts the looping task to
sleep for a tick so the preempted task can make progress.

Steven Rostedt changed it to use a hrtimer instead of msleep():
|
|Ulrich Obergfell pointed out that cpu_chill() calls msleep() which is woken
|up by the ksoftirqd running the TIMER softirq. But as the cpu_chill() is
|called from softirq context, it may block the ksoftirqd() from running, in
|which case, it may never wake up the msleep() causing the deadlock.
|
|I checked the vmcore, and irq/74-qla2xxx is stuck in the msleep() call,
|running on CPU 8. The one ksoftirqd that is stuck, happens to be the one that
|runs on CPU 8, and it is blocked on a lock held by irq/74-qla2xxx. As that
|ksoftirqd is the one that will wake up irq/74-qla2xxx, and it happens to be
|blocked on a lock that irq/74-qla2xxx holds, we have our deadlock.
|
|The solution is not to convert the cpu_chill() back to a cpu_relax() as that
|will re-create a possible live lock that the cpu_chill() fixed earlier, and may
|also leave this bug open on other softirqs. The fix is to remove the
|dependency on ksoftirqd from cpu_chill(). That is, instead of calling
|msleep() that requires ksoftirqd to wake it up, use the
|hrtimer_nanosleep() code that does the wakeup from hard irq context.
|
||Looks to be the lock of the block softirq. I don't have the core dump
||anymore, but from what I could tell the ksoftirqd was blocked on the
||block softirq lock, where the block softirq handler did a msleep
||(called by the qla2xxx interrupt handler).
||
||Looking at trigger_softirq() in block/blk-softirq.c, it can do a
||smp_callfunction() to another cpu to run the block softirq. If that
||happens to be the cpu where the qla2xx irq handler is doing the block
||softirq and is in a middle of a msleep(), I believe the ksoftirqd will
||try to run the softirq. If it does that, then BOOM, it's deadlocked
||because the ksoftirqd will never run the timer softirq either.
|
||I should have also stated that it was only one lock that was involved.
||But the lock owner was doing a msleep() that requires a wakeup by
||ksoftirqd to continue. If ksoftirqd happens to be blocked on a lock
||held by the msleep() caller, then you have your deadlock.
||
||It's best not to have any softirqs going to sleep requiring another
||softirq to wake it up. Note, if we ever require a timer softirq to do a
||cpu_chill() it will most definitely hit this deadlock.
