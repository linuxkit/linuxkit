Subject: [PATCH] sched/swait: include wait.h

kbuild bot reported against an intermediate RT patch that the build
fails with:

>    In file included from include/linux/completion.h:12:0,
>                     from include/linux/rcupdate_wait.h:10,

That error vanishes a few patches later (in the RT queue) because wait.h
is then pulled in by other means. It does not seem to surface on !RT.
I think that swait should include a header file for a function/macro
(___wait_is_interruptible()) it is using.
