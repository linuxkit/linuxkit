Subject: [PATCH 06/29] hrtimer: Ensure POSIX compliance (relative
 CLOCK_REALTIME hrtimers)

POSIX specification defines, that relative CLOCK_REALTIME timers are not
affected by clock modifications. Those timers have to use CLOCK_MONOTONIC
to ensure POSIX compliance.

The introduction of the additional mode HRTIMER_MODE_PINNED broke this
requirement for pinned timers. There is no user space visible impact
because user space timers are not using the pinned mode, but for
consistency reasons this needs to be fixed.

Check whether the mode has the HRTIMER_MODE_REL bit set instead of
comparing with HRTIMER_MODE_ABS.

Fixes: 597d0275736d ("timers: Framework for identifying pinned timers")
