Subject: [PATCH 08/10] vmbus: fix missed ring events on boot

During initialization, the channel initialization code schedules the
tasklet to scan the VMBUS receive event page (i.e. simulates an
interrupt). The problem was that it invokes the tasklet on a different
CPU from where it normally runs and therefore if an event is present,
it will clear the bit but not find the associated channel.

This can lead to missed events, typically stuck tasks, during bootup
when sub channels are being initialized. Typically seen as stuck
boot with 8 or more CPU's.

This patch is not necessary for upstream (4.11 and later) since
commit 631e63a9f346 ("vmbus: change to per channel tasklet").
This changed vmbus code to get rid of common tasklet which
caused the problem.
