Subject: [PATCH] lockdep: disable self-test
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The self-test wasn't always 100% accurate for RT. We disabled a few
tests which failed because they had a different semantic for RT. Some
still reported false positives. Now the selftest locks up the system
during boot and it needs to be investigatedâ€¦
