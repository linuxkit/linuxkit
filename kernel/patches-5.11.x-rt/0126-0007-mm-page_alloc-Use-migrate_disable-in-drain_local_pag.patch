Subject: [PATCH 7/8] mm: page_alloc: Use migrate_disable() in
 drain_local_pages_wq()

drain_local_pages_wq() disables preemption to avoid CPU migration during
CPU hotplug and can't use cpus_read_lock().

Using migrate_disable() works here, too. The scheduler won't take the
CPU offline until the task left the migrate-disable section.

Use migrate_disable() in drain_local_pages_wq().
