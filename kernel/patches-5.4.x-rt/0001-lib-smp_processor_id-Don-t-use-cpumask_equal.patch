Subject: [PATCH] lib/smp_processor_id: Don't use cpumask_equal()

The check_preemption_disabled() function uses cpumask_equal() to see
if the task is bounded to the current CPU only. cpumask_equal() calls
memcmp() to do the comparison. As x86 doesn't have __HAVE_ARCH_MEMCMP,
the slow memcmp() function in lib/string.c is used.

On a RT kernel that call check_preemption_disabled() very frequently,
below is the perf-record output of a certain microbenchmark:

  42.75%  2.45%  testpmd [kernel.kallsyms] [k] check_preemption_disabled
  40.01% 39.97%  testpmd [kernel.kallsyms] [k] memcmp

We should avoid calling memcmp() in performance critical path. So the
cpumask_equal() call is now replaced with an equivalent simpler check.
