Subject: [PATCH] sched: __set_cpus_allowed_ptr(): Check cpus_mask, not
 cpus_ptr

This function is concerned with the long-term cpu mask, not the
transitory mask the task might have while migrate disabled.  Before
this patch, if a task was migrate disabled at the time
__set_cpus_allowed_ptr() was called, and the new mask happened to be
equal to the cpu that the task was running on, then the mask update
would be lost.
