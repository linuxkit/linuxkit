llmnrd - Link-Local Multicast Resolution Daemon
===============================================

llmnrd is a daemon implementing the Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)
protocol according to RFC 4795. It currently only supports Linux, as it uses the
netlink kernel interface.

llmnrd will respond to name resolution queries sent by Windows clients in
networks where no DNS server is available. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

Installation
------------

To build and install llmnrd use the following commands:

  $ make
  $ sudo make install

By default, the llmnrd binary will be installed to /usr/local/sbin. To install
the binary to a different installation path, use:

  $ make
  $ sudo make prefix=<path> install

Cross-Compilation
-----------------

To cross-compile llmnrd for a different architecture, use the CROSS_COMPILE make
variable. To e.g. build it using the arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain use:

  $ make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-

When cross-compiling, you usually don't want to install the generated binary to
your root filesystem, but to the sysroot of a cross-compiled system. Use the
DESTDIR variable to change the installation destination path, e.g.

  $ make DESTDIR=$HOME/sysroot/ prefix=/usr install
