# Contributing to LinuxKit

Want to hack on this project? Awesome! Here are instructions to get you started.

Additional information can be found in the docs:
[issue triage](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/master/docs/issue-triage.md),
 and [review process](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/master/docs/reviewing.md).

## Reporting security issues

The LinuxKit maintainers take security seriously. If you discover a security
issue, please bring it to their attention right away!

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue, instead send your report privately to
[security@docker.com](mailto:security@docker.com).

Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you for it.
We also like to send gifts&mdash;if you're into Docker schwag, make sure to let
us know. We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, but are not
ruling it out in the future.

## Reporting other issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you
encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report,
and will thank you for it!

Check that [our issue database](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/issues)
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. Do *not* leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as they
only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it. However, if you
have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help
resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

Also include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and
applicable. This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as a gist (https://gist.github.com).
Don't forget to remove sensitive data from your logfiles before posting (you can
replace those parts with "REDACTED").

## Quick contribution tips and guidelines

This section gives the experienced contributor some tips and guidelines.

### Pull requests are always welcome

Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Found a bug and know how to fix
it? Do it! We will appreciate it. Any significant improvement should be
documented as [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/issues) before
anybody starts working on it.

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests. We do our best to process them
quickly. If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't get
discouraged! Our contributor's guide explains [the review process we
use for simple changes](https://docs.docker.com/opensource/workflow/make-a-contribution/).

### Design and cleanup proposals

You can propose new designs for existing features. You can also design
entirely new features. We really appreciate contributors who want to refactor or
otherwise cleanup our project. For information on making these types of
contributions, see [the advanced contribution
section](https://docs.docker.com/opensource/workflow/advanced-contributing/) in
the contributors guide.

We try hard to keep LinuxKit lean and focused. LinuxKit can't do everything for
everybody. This means that we might decide against incorporating a new feature.
However, there might be a way to implement that feature *on top of* LinuxKit.

### Commit Messages

Commit messages must start with a capitalized and short summary (max. 50 chars)
written in the imperative, followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory
text which is separated from the summary by an empty line.

Commit messages should follow best practices, including explaining the context
of the problem and how it was solved, including in caveats or follow up changes
required. They should tell the story of the change and provide readers
understanding of what led to it.

If you're lost about what this even means, please see [How to Write a Git
Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for a start.

In practice, the best approach to maintaining a nice commit message is to
leverage a `git add -p` and `git commit --amend` to formulate a solid
changeset. This allows one to piece together a change, as information becomes
available.

If you squash a series of commits, don't just submit that. Re-write the commit
message, as if the series of commits was a single stroke of brilliance.

That said, there is no requirement to have a single commit for a PR, as long as
each commit tells the story. For example, if there is a feature that requires a
package, it might make sense to have the package in a separate commit then have
a subsequent commit that uses it.

Remember, you're telling part of the story with the commit message. Don't make
your chapter weird.


### Review

Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, then make the
suggested modifications and push additional commits to your feature branch. Post
a comment after pushing. New commits show up in the pull request automatically,
but the reviewers are notified only when you comment.

Pull requests must be cleanly rebased on top of master without multiple branches
mixed into the PR.

**Git tip**: If your PR no longer merges cleanly, use `rebase master` in your
feature branch to update your pull request rather than `merge master`.

Before you make a pull request, squash your commits into logical units of work
using `git rebase -i` and `git push -f`. A logical unit of work is a consistent
set of patches that should be reviewed together: for example, upgrading the
version of a vendored dependency and taking advantage of its now available new
feature constitute two separate units of work. Implementing a new function and
calling it in another file constitute a single logical unit of work. The very
high majority of submissions should have a single commit, so if in doubt: squash
down to one.

After every commit, [make sure the test suite passes]
(https://docs.docker.com/opensource/project/test-and-docs/). Include documentation
changes in the same pull request so that a revert would remove all traces of
the feature or fix.

Include an issue reference like `Closes #XXXX` or `Fixes #XXXX` in commits that
close an issue. Including references automatically closes the issue on a merge.

### Merge approval

Docker maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments or GitHub approval
on the code review to indicate acceptance.

A change requires at least one LGTM from a maintainers of each component
affected. A list of maintainers can be found in the [MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS)
file.

### Community Guidelines and Code of Conduct

When contributing to this project, we expect you to respect our community
guidelines and [code of conduct](https://github.com/docker/code-of-conduct)

We want to keep the community awesome, growing and collaborative. We need your
help to keep it that way. To help with this we've come up with some general
guidelines for the community as a whole:

* Be nice: Be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members:
  no regional, racial, gender, or other abuse will be tolerated. We like
  nice people way better than mean ones!

* Encourage diversity and participation: Make everyone in our community feel
  welcome, regardless of their background and the extent of their
  contributions, and do everything possible to encourage participation in
  our community.

* Keep it legal: Basically, don't get us in trouble. Share only content that
  you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don't break
  the law.

* Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and
  avoid off-topic discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond
  to an email you are potentially sending to a large number of people. Please
  consider this before you update. Also remember that nobody likes spam.

* Don't send email to the maintainers: There's no need to send email to the
  maintainers to ask them to investigate an issue or to take a look at a
  pull request. Instead of sending an email, GitHub mentions should be
  used to ping maintainers to review a pull request, a proposal or an
  issue.

### Guideline violations â€” 3 strikes method

The point of this section is not to find opportunities to punish people, but we
do need a fair way to deal with people who are making our community suck.

1. First occurrence: We'll give you a friendly, but public reminder that the
   behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.

2. Second occurrence: We will send you a private message with a warning that
   any additional violations will result in removal from the community.

3. Third occurrence: Depending on the violation, we may need to delete or ban
   your account.

**Notes:**

* Obvious spammers are banned on first occurrence. If we don't do this, we'll
  have spam all over the place.

* Violations are forgiven after 6 months of good behavior, and we won't hold a
  grudge.

* People who commit minor infractions will get some education, rather than
  hammering them in the 3 strikes process.

* The rules apply equally to everyone in the community, no matter how much
  you've contributed.

* Extreme violations of a threatening, abusive, destructive or illegal nature
  will be addressed immediately and are not subject to 3 strikes or forgiveness.

* Contact abuse@docker.com to report abuse or appeal violations. In the case of
  appeals, we know that mistakes happen, and we'll work with you to come up with a
  fair solution if there has been a misunderstanding.

### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your
signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass
it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

```
Developer Certificate of Origin
