# Development report for 9 April 2017

The fifth weekly development report. Feel free to send PRs if you want to add to these reports (or correct them).

## New Contributors

Ilya @errordeveloper (Weave) has started working on [Kubernetes support](../projects/kubernetes). This also fits with the [infrakit etcd demo](../projects/demo) that Rolf is working on. The aim is to do both a desktop version and later a full production quality deployment with high availability.

Dave @dave-tucker is working on CI, and the [roadmap for testing](https://github.com/docker/moby/issues/1336).

Welcome everyone, looking forward to your contributions and working with you. Please open issues on github if you need help, or ask on #moby in the [Docker community slack](https://community.docker.com/registrations/groups/4316).

## Projects

Ian @ijc25 added a [swarmd](../projects/swarmd) project, that incorporates his [WIP patches](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/pull/1965) to run swarmkit standalone using just `containerd` rather than Docker.

There were updates to okernel and miragesdk.

We added a roadmap for the [Landlock LSM support](projects/landlock/roadmap.md). Landlock is an eBPF based Linux Security Module being developed by @l0kod which promises to be an excellent match for containers.

## This week

This was a busy week, with a lot of refactoring and rebasing.

The `moby run` command got backend support for GCP from @dave-tucker [#1492](https://github.com/docker/moby/pull/1492) and qemu from @thebsdbox [#1521](https://github.com/docker/moby/pull/1521).

We stopped using the `riddler` tool and added a direct conversion from the yaml config to OCI for running system contaniners. More config options were added, and there is now [documentation for the yaml](../docs/yaml.md). We stopped using some of the previous names to standardise on names closer to the underlying OCI field names, from @justincormack.

@riyazdf added support for content trust settings in the yaml file and set up signing for the kernel, which will be rolled out to other images.

@shykes suggested some section renames which we implemented, the initial containers that run once are now "onboot" and the long running ones are "services", which is much clearer.

The `init` section was converted to a list, so `runc` and `containerd` can easily be updated independently.

The issues with shared mounts, and allowing containers to mount on the host were hopefully all resolved in [#1557](https://github.com/docker/moby/pull/1557).

## Planned for next week

- switch to using `containerd` finally
- arm64 prototypes
- documentation
- preparation for Dockercon, finalizing demos

## Dockercon

- there will be a talk by @justincormack on Moby (currently billed as containerd...)
- there will be a Docker Security talk with @riyazdf (`Secure Substrate: Least Privilege Container Deployment`) that will highlight Moby
- both these talks will have some time for demos
- there will be a session and lots of time to talk at the Thursday summit - get in touch if you need an invite. Please add topics you
  would like to talk about to [the list](../docs/dockercon-summit.md) via PR.
